# origin of react + intro vid 1 
react is a open source js library for UI components
created by facebook 
focus only for UI, that is it 

react has a components based archetecture
website = header + footer + sitemap (these are components)

## advantages
- code reusablity: you dont have to copy code to do the same thing again and again 
- react is declarative: just tell it what you want to do 

# folder structure
- when using VITE + react
- If we use CRA (Create react app, the vanilla method) then the entry point for react is via index.js
- for VITE, entry point is main.jsx the main.jsx is similar to how we have a main() in typicall C programs
- imports of VITE are slightly different from CRA (vanilla)

# react components
- components are a part of UI
- a basic site = header + footer + sidenav + main content + fotter
- the root component, aka app component contains all the components which you create
- hence root is the parent of all components
- component are reusable, you can alter the style of each component
- a component can contain other components (nesting is allowed)

# types of components
1. functional component (FC)
- directly returns a HTML 
- just js functions
obj of props--> [FC] --> return HTML(JSX)

2. class component
- just eS6 classes
- create a class which extend the component class 
- then create a render method to return the HTML 
- since its a component which uses a class, it can hence store some data for its state 
`import React from 'react'
import { Component } from 'react'

class Welcome extends Component{
    render(){
        return <h1></h1>
    }
}
`




both have their use cases. which we will see sooon

# jsx (java scipt xml)
- extension to js 
- jsx tags have tag name , attribute, and children
- jsx is then converted to pure js 

# things which are changed in JSX
- class -> className
- for -> htmlFor 
- onclick -> onClick 
- tabindex -> tabindex
